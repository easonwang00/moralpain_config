# How to build moralpain for Program and Data Representation
This directory supports building of a docker image for the moralpain project to
DockerHub (a commercial image registry) so that others can pull it, exec it,
and use it through VSCode.

Here are the commands needed to buid, push (to DockerHub), and use our
container. We assume you've already got docker running on your computer. Make
sure that you're logged in to DockerHub.

## Build image from Dockerfile

To build a new version of the moralpain image,
run the following command in a terminal with this
directory as the current working directory. The
repository image name is kevinsullivan/moralpain.
It will have the tag, *latest*.

``` sh
docker build -t kevinsullivan/moralpain:latest . -m 8g
```

## Push image to DockerHub

To push a copy of this image to dockerhub, do this:

``` sh
docker push kevinsullivan/moralpain
?
ghcr.io/kevinsullivan/moralpain_config:main

```

## Pull image from DockerHub

To pull a copy of the image to your local host machine, do this:

```sh
docker pull kevinsullivan/moralpain
ghcr.io/kevinsullivan/moralpain_config:main
```

## Start container

To launch a container using this image run the following command.
Replace %source_directory_on_host% with the host directory you want
the VM to access as /dm. Replace %container_name% with the name you'd
like to give to the launched docker container. We suggest giving it
a name that reflects the local directory that is mounted on its
container-local directory, /dm.

``` sh
docker run -it --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --rm --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    --name %container_name% -v %source_directory_on_host%:/dm kevinsullivan/moralpain \
    /bin/bash
```

## Get terminal into container

To connect to a terminal shell into the VM, do this:

``` sh
docker exec -it moralpain /bin/bash
```

## Stop running container

To stop a container from a terminal on your host machine, do this:

``` sh
docker stop %container_name%
```

To stop a running image from a terminal into the container, and exit the terminal process, do this:

``` sh
exit
```
